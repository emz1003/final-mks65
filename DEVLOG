Add initial file structure and file details, including main function and makefile.

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-02
Coded the beginning of the user interface (shell.c)

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-05
Made changes to the interface and editted the makefile to make it include shell.c
Created the file gameplay.c, added it to the makefile
Coded the functions initializeBoard (initializes a gameBoard) and printBoard (prints the board out), kept on editting until both functions worked

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-07
Coded the function putShip (places a ship down on to the board)

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-08
Coded the function gamePlay (contains the entire game play), debugged the function but the ships wouldn't be oriented in the right direction

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-09
Worked for a long time to figure out the coordinate system of the board and place the ships down accordingly.
putShip finally worked correctly

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-10
Created the function addShiptoBoard to make putting the ships on the board more modular
Somehow the coordinates were still messed up, I finally fixed everything

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-11
To make sure that the coordinates the user inputs to place the ships are valid, I created the function isCoorValid. Tested it with the rest of the functions in gameplay.c and it works!
Created the main gameBoard, formatted the game to print both your board and the main board together. But for some reason, the main board isn't setting up right...

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-12
Main board is created correctly
Coded the function hitTarget, which makes a target either a hit or a miss
Also made hitTarget check if the coordinate entered was valid
Tested everything, but it doesn't work. Must work on it tomorrow.

Add to gitignore and initial create db function in interface file.

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-13
After lots of debugging, the hitTarget works! Works great with the mainboard. Next steps: look at pipes for a two player game!

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-14
Coded the isWin function to see when the game will end, looked at pipes to start coding that

emilyZ -- 2020-01-19 23:43
finish all interface functions

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-19
Was very very sad when I spent 2 hours trying to figure out how to deal with the branch that I created off of master- there were a few errors
Coded playerOne and playerTwo to try and get a pipe working: it didn't work after many many tries =(
After lots of hard work, pipes are implemented! Starting to implement the gameplay on both ends
After lots of debugging, I implemented the gameplay with the pipes! Still some things that aren't working though

emilyZ -- 2020-01-20 18:15
update README, PROPOSAL, and reformat DEVLOG.

kaitlynL -- 2020-01-20
Spent plenty of time trying to get the mainBoards to communicate effectively
Finally got it, had to create an entire new pipe for new information
After lots of debugging, the game is finally functional! However, when someone wins, the program doesn't effectively exit
