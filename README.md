Team members: Kaitlyn Lau, Emily Zhang </br>
Project: Battleship
Description: Create a simple program where users can log in to play and join a battleship game that can be played on a terminal.

### Required libraries: NONE

### Instructions:
1. Open 2 terminal sessions
2. Run ```make``` then ```make run``` on both sessions
3. Use ```help``` to familiarize yourself with the commands available
4. Sign up if you are not yet a registered user
5. Sign in to play a game
6. On one terminal, the player should create a game
7. On the other terminal, the player should join the game
8. Follow in-game instructions
Note: Players may find it effective to minimize their terminal session or hide it with another tab when it is their opponent's turn

### Features:
- A database made of shared memory and facilitated by semaphores that allows for the storage of all user information, up to 32 users
- Pipes that facilitate the interaction between two users during gameplay
- Allocating memory for program functionality

### Attempted: Nothing that we have not accomplished yet.
